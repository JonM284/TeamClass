Reference sheet for all variables and what they do, no matter how redundant.
This sheet is sorted by script name
Don't forget, you can quickly search with ctrl+f, but if you do make sure you're checking the.. 
correct script, because more than one script can have the same named variable



HeathAndShield{
		currentHealth: The current amount of health the player has.

		currentShield: The current amount of shield the player has.

		isInvinsible: Not INVISIBLE! This variable dictates whether you are invinsible or not. If you're invinsible, you cannot take damage, or receive
					  knockback from enemy attacks. You may want to set this to true for example, If you're getting up from getting knocked down, or maybe
					  invinsibility is just a power up, and so on...

		isInvinsibleTimer: Not sure if we will need this variable, but while this number is positive, set 'isInvinsible' to true, and if its <= 0, set 'isInvinsible' to false

		maxHealth: The maximum amount of health the character can have at one time.

		maxShield: The maximum amount of shield the character can have at one time.

		shieldRegenSpeed: How fast your shield regenerates, after the shieldWaitTime is over

		shieldWaitTime: The amount of time (in seconds) that needs to pass without taking damage, before your shield can start to regenerate.
}



Movement{
		airSpeed: How fast you can move left and right while in the air.

		canWallCling: If true, the character can temporarily, or permanantly cling to walls (we didnt discuss this yet, so i dont know if we will
					  make wall cling a thing, and if it is a temporary cling.)

		gravity: How strong the downward force to the player is. 
	  		     /* i may need more types of gravity modifiers, but i think one is fine for now. Also the reason i have gravity...
				  * here instead of on the rigidbody is mostly preference, but also so it can be easily changed at will in...
				  * the event we want to have gravity modifiers due to support character interference
				  * -Ganderman Dan
                  */

		hitStun: Is how long you have to wait before you can do something after getting hit, this number is affected directly by the
	             enemies attack, this function should get called when you get hit. While this number is greater than 0, you cannot do anything
				 Refer to the GetHit() function for further explanation 

		jumpForce: The upward force added to the player when the jump button is pressed. Weight will also impact how high you go when you jump.

		numJumps: The amount of times you can jump before touching the ground again.

		runSpeed: How fast you move left and right while grounded and also running //I dont know if running is in the game, but i put the variable there just in case

		walkSpeed: How fast you can move left and right while grounded.

		weight: How heavy the player is. The weight of your character will help determine how far you fly when an enemy hits you, it will also
				have an impact on how high you go when you jump (a heavier character will require a greater jump force to go the same height as a lighter character)
				A similar thing will happen with gravity.
